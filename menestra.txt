This is a traditional Italian soup. Serve with very crusty bread for dunking

Ingredients:
2 lbs of prosciutto sliced VERY thick, about an inch will do, cubed.
8 clovers of garlic, sliced
1 head of escarole
1 bunch of dandelion
1 head of savoy cabbage.
2 table spoons of olive oil
4 quarts water
1 can low sodium chicken broth/stock
In a large lidded pot heat the olive oil, once smoking add the garlic and meat. Sautee until the meat starts to brown. Add the water and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cover. Let cook for 4-5 hours stirring once an hour.
Once the meat is pull apart tender, chop the vegetables. You don't want them too small, this should be a very leafy soup. Add the vegetables and stir until wilted. Cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 20 minutes. Laddle into bowls and serve with 3-4 pieces of crusty bread.
Optionally you can also add the following ingredients:
Pepperoni about an hour before you add the greens
A small fresh mozzarella cubed, add after you wilt the greens.
Sweet Italian sausage, brown with the prosciutto, remove and add back in about an hour before the greens.
This should serve about 8 people.

Very yummy!
