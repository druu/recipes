For us, that is a meal made from leftovers, so you can vary the ingredients:

16:10 < _druu> moveax: think it was something like onions, mushrooms, paprika(green and yellow), chili... fry till all the water is gone, throw in ground meat... when that's ready, add diced tomatoes,  salt 
               pepper garlic basil, thyme, oregano (basically the "italian spice mix") and red wine and whisky....
16:11 < _druu> moveax: and when cooking pasta, add a bit of "gem端sebr端he" :)
16:12 < moveax> _druu: that here will be like. chop onions and garlic, fry teh meat, add onions and garlic while it gets brown, add chopped zuchini and paprika, diced tomatoes, balsamico and spices as whished
